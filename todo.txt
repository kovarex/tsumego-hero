Fixes:
  - Solved + green isn't shown when it is already solved when opening
  - integrate besogo tests into our testsuite (/besogo/tests.html)
  - Look at the besogo bug related to added variations making solutions incorrect
  Time mode:
    - Integrate the number of tsumegos per rank, we can probably just get it with one select, if it is too slow, we can do precalculation, but in db, not the json one that was done previously
    - solve that it shows array in the rank when solving time problems
 - diffs viewing.
 - cover user viewing (has error)
 - Mode switching fixes - as with time mode, there should probably be rating/play for rating and
   level mode should be the tsumegos/play.
 UserBoards:
  - Currently there is a table AND field in player
  - Get rid of the table, and use only the field
  - convert the field to a bitfield, so it is just an integer

Low priority
  Time mode:
  - Way to see all sessions of the current rank when asked for
