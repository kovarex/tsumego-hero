Fixes:
 - The user rank should show the rank instead of array in time mode
 - diffs viewing.
 - Mode switching fixes - as with time mode, there should probably be rating/play for rating based selection
 - sandbox functionality
 - adding new tsumegos
 - publishing
 UserBoards:
  - Currently there is a table AND field in player
  - Get rid of the table, and use only the field
  - convert the field to a bitfield, so it is just an integer

Low priority
  Time mode:
  - Way to see all sessions of the current rank when asked for
