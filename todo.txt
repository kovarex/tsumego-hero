Fixes:
 - rating selection mode is reported to be broken
Refactoring:
  - Rules of capturing races
  - Use tsumego button for the buttons in the index page (tsumego of the day), maybe remove tsumego of the day instead.
  - Make tsumego button more encapsulated (ideally the tooltip etc right in the button, without extra javascript call needed)
 UserBoards:
   - convert the field to a bitfield, so it is just an integer

Low priority
  Time mode:
  - Way to see all sessions of the current rank when asked for
