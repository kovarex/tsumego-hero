- Moving to tsumego.com
- Removed half-working features for non logged players (hearts, tsumego status, levels)
- Unified the logging mechanism, should be stable now.
- Optimisation of set index, set view and play.
- Always showing XP and rating when relevant: "what you see is what you get".
- Changed XP formula to be always based on rating, different graphs (less for easier ones, more for harder ones)
- Changed rating formula to be the same as the official tournament rating formula, current modifier is 0.5
