# tsumego-hero-app

## Status & Requirements

- composer
- CakePHP 2.x latest
- PHP 8.4
- MySQL 8.0

Also:
- For best PHP dev I recommend [PHPStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).
- For local env best to use [ddev](https://ddev.com/get-started/).

##PHP 8.4 install

to install it in the linux (outside docker), you can do:
./setup/php-install.sh

##Selenium
The tool to run actual firefox to test the javascript and other things related to the generated pages
you need to install firefox in the docker, this solution from https://askubuntu.com/questions/1502031/how-to-install-firefox-directly-from-mozilla-with-apt worked for me:
./setup/firefox-install

And then I need to manually start the firefox client (there needs to be a better way)

./selenium/geckodriver

## Debug with phpstorm
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/debugging-with-phpstorm-ultimate-guide.html#setup-from-zero

For command line, this needs to be specified locally
set XDEBUG_MODE=debug& set XDEBUG_SESSION=1
or
export XDEBUG_MODE=debug& export XDEBUG_SESSION=1


## Setup

To locally develop and setup, use ddev from inside app/ folder:
- Copy .ddev.example/ folder to .ddev/
- Modify the config.yaml file to your needs.

By default, it uses `tsumego` as name.

Then from ROOT of the project run:

    ddev config (ONLY if you didnt copy the existing config.yaml!)
    ddev start

To jump to your app in browser:

    ddev launch

dbs (PHPMyAdmin):

    ddev phpmyadmin

ssh login:

    ddev ssh

Run

    composer update

locally to install all latest dependencies.

Make sure to create your own database.php file in config/ with your DB credentials.
And import any data you need.

Open

    https://tsumego3.ddev.site/

to browse your project now.

## Database Migrations

This project uses [Phinx](https://phinx.org/) for database migrations.
Phinx is a database migration tool that allows you to version control your database schema changes.

### Configuration

Phinx is configured via `phinx.php` which automatically loads database credentials from CakePHP's `config/database.php`. Migrations are stored in `db/migrations/` and seeds in `db/seeds/`.

### Common Migration Commands

```bash
# Create a new migration
vendor/bin/phinx create MyNewMigration

# Run all pending migrations
composer migrate
# or: vendor/bin/phinx migrate

# Rollback the last migration
composer migrate-rollback
# or: vendor/bin/phinx rollback

# Check migration status
composer migrate-status
# or: vendor/bin/phinx status

# Run migrations for test environment
composer migrate-test
# or: vendor/bin/phinx migrate -e test

# Seed the database
vendor/bin/phinx seed:run
```

### Creating Migrations

When you create a new migration, it will generate a timestamped file in `db/migrations/`:

```bash
vendor/bin/phinx create AddUserEmailColumn
```

This creates a file like `20250130123456_add_user_email_column.php`. Edit the migration to define your schema changes:

```php
<?php
use Phinx\Migration\AbstractMigration;

class AddUserEmailColumn extends AbstractMigration
{
    public function change()
    {
        $table = $this->table('users');
        $table->addColumn('email', 'string', ['limit' => 255, 'null' => false])
              ->addIndex(['email'], ['unique' => true])
              ->update();
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

- Always use `change()` method when possible (Phinx can automatically reverse it)
- Use `up()` and `down()` methods for complex migrations that can't be auto-reversed
- Follow CakePHP's table naming conventions (plural, snake_case)
- Foreign keys should follow pattern: `{singular_table}_id`
- Always test migrations in development before running in production
- Run migrations as part of deployment process

### Documentation

- [Phinx Documentation](https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/index.html)
- [Writing Migrations](https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/migrations.html)
- [Seeding Data](https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/seeding.html)

## Code Quality & Testing
```bash
composer test        # PHPUnit tests
composer cs-check   # PHP CodeSniffer
composer cs-fix     # Auto-fix CS issues
composer stan       # PHPStan static analysis

### also:
composer cs-modified # Only run phpcs on modified files
```

### Development Commands Quick Reference
```bash
# Specific folder analysis
composer stan -- src/Controller
composer cs-check -- src/Utility

# Test specific methods (side ddev container!):
vendor/bin/phpunit path/to/test.php --filter=testMethodName
```

## Deploy
On the server in ROOT:
```
sh deploy.sh
```
It will run git pull + composer install etc.
