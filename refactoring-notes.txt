Stuff to do soon

1) The goal is to use SetConnection id links as much as possible
  a) There is a lot of code now to check whether the extra sid parameter is needed when more sets are connected to one tsumego.
  b) Nicer links of tsumego.com/<number>
  c) Less bugs, as it is more straightforward, we need to know the setconnection id  anyway

  Currently, it is done just for next/back button as an experiment, and some of the js code changes probably broke/confused some of the other buttons which were not converted so far.

2) Time mode
  a) Fully teset cover/refactor and fix the Time Mode.
  b) Consider getting rid of the weird activeRank (which is something like time mode session uid), and just create new overview for the current time mode run.

3) Check and cleanup rest of the codepaths that create tsumego attempts, they are either redundant, or just add some slight change which can be reflected in PlayResultProcessorComponent

4) Consider checking out this:  https://www.selenium.dev/, apparently it can be used to test the frontent javascript. Since there is a lot of happening in javascript, it can get (and would) get broken
     under the radar all the time.
     Having set of tests which would test the javascript errors and result (like the buttons generated being proper, the go board being loaded etc).
