Stuff to do soon

1)Use SetConnection id links as much as possible in the already functional form of tsumego.com/<number>
  a) There is a lot of code now to check whether the extra sid parameter is needed when more sets are connected to one tsumego.
  c) Less bugs, as it is more straightforward, we need to know the setconnection id  anyway

  Currently, it is done just for next/back button as an experiment, and some of the js code changes probably broke/confused some of the other buttons which were not converted so far.

2) Time mode
  a) Fully teset cover/refactor and fix the Time Mode.
  b) Consider getting rid of the weird activeRank (which is something like time mode session uid), and just create new overview for the current time mode run.

3) Check and cleanup rest of the codepaths that create tsumego attempts, they are either redundant, or just add some slight change which can be reflected in PlayResultProcessorComponent
