; Local development overrides for asset_compress.ini
; COPY THIS FILE to asset_compress.local.ini and customize for your environment
; asset_compress.local.ini is gitignored
;
; This example shows common development settings for easy debugging

[General]
; Enable controller for on-the-fly asset generation
; When true: /cache_js/app.js served by PHP controller (builds on each request)
; When false: /cache_js/app.js must be pre-built with ./bin/cake asset_compress build
; DEVELOPMENT: Set to true - NO NEED to rebuild after every code change!
; PRODUCTION: Set to false - serve pre-built static files (faster)
alwaysEnableController = true

; Don't cache config (reload on file changes)
; When true: Changes to asset_compress.ini require app restart
; When false: Changes to asset_compress.ini take effect immediately
cacheConfig = false

; Disable gzip in development (not needed, simpler debugging)
gzip = false

; RECOMMENDED FOR DEVELOPMENT: Disable minification for easier debugging
; This concatenates files but doesn't minify them, making browser DevTools more useful

[js]
; Disable JS minification (keep source readable in browser)
filters[] = 
; Keep source maps enabled for debugging
sourceMap = true
; Enable timestamps for cache busting in development (edit file → browser sees change)
timestamp = true

[css]
; Disable CSS minification (keep source readable)
filters[] =
; Enable timestamps for cache busting in development
timestamp = true 

; ALTERNATIVE: Use 'raw' => true in views to load individual files without concatenation
; echo $this->AssetCompress->script('app', ['raw' => true]);
